# TSP Virtualization Project
> Final project designed to implement the different topics learned throughout the course. The baseline of the project has been developed on Kubernetes, it implements a MongoDB database structure with a web administrator of the database known as Mongo-express. In my case, I developed two projects, one basic and one advanced. In the advanced project we have the same structure of MongoDB and Mongo-express but in this one a monitoring system is also implemented on Kubernetes using Prometheus and Grafana to obtain metrics on our database.
## Requirements
### For basic project
1. Docker
2. Virtualbox
3. Minikube
4. Kubectl
### For advanced project
> Same requirements for the basic project and some knowledge about Grafana and Prometheus.

## Installation
> It depends if you are interested in the basic project or the advanced one. Check the readme file in the project that you are interested.
