# Basic mongodb project
In the basic project we are going to set up a MongoDB environment and manage the database using Mongo-express.

## Installation
In this scenario, it is not so necessary to have so many resources, but I always start my minkube with assigned resources to know how much I have to work with.

1. `minikube start --cpus 4 --memory 8192 --vm-driver virtualbox`
